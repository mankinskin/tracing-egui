# tracing-egui

A [tracing `Layer`](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/0.2.20/tracing_subscriber/layer/trait.Layer.html)
and [egui `Widget`](https://docs.rs/egui/0.13.1/egui/widgets/trait.Widget.html) to capture tracing events
and display them in-app in a filterable and searchable manner.

More functionality, examples, and documentation TODO, but it's functional enough to use (as a POC) already.
